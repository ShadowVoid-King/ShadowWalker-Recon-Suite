**ShadowWalker** is a powerful, modular automation framework for reconnaissance and attack surface discovery. Designed for bug bounty hunters, penetration testers, and red teamers, it streamlines the entire process from subdomain enumeration to vulnerability analysis. It separates reconnaissance from active scanning, allowing for a more controlled and methodical approach to security assessments.

---

## ًںڑ€ Features âڑ™ï¸ڈâœ¨

- **Modular Phases:** Run scans in distinct stages: Recon, Discovery, Vulnerability Scanning, and Takeover Analysis.  
- **Dual Scan Modes:** Choose between a `fast` non-intrusive scan and a `deep` comprehensive scan.  
- **Automated Tool Management:** Install, update, and check all dependencies with simple commands.  
- **Permanent Environment Setup:** Automatically configures the Go environment path for globally accessible tools.  
- **Structured Output:** Saves results for each target in a clean, organized `~/Hunt/TargetName/` directory.  
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Creates a detailed `scan.log` for each target, recording all actions, results, file sizes, and errors.  
- **Markdown Reporting:** Generates a `_SUMMARY.md` report that is updated after each phase.

## ًں’، Usage & Commands ًں–¥ï¸ڈًں”چًں“‹

You can run the script with CLI flags or interactively.

### ًں“¦ Tool Management

```bash
./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --check        # Check all dependencies
./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --install      # Install all tools
./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --update       # Update Go-based tools
```

### ًں”چ Reconnaissance

```bash
./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --recon-fast example.com
./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --recon-deep example.com
```

> Output will be saved to: `~/Hunt/example.com/`

### ًں§  Post-Recon Modules

```bash
./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --discover example.com     # Content Discovery
./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --vuln-scan example.com    # Vulnerability Scanning
./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --takeover example.com     # Subdomain Takeover
```

## ًں“ڑ Recommended Workflow ًں—‚ï¸ڈًں”ژًں› ï¸ڈ

1. **Start with deep recon:**

   ```bash
   ./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --recon-deep target.com
   ```

2. **Analyze recon results in the generated directories.**

3. **Run discovery phase:**

   ```bash
   ./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --discover target.com
   ```

4. **In another terminal, scan for vulnerabilities:**

   ```bash
   ./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --vuln-scan target.com
   ```

5. **Check for subdomain takeover:**

   ```bash
   ./ShadowWalker-Kali.bash --takeover target.com
   ```

6. **Review output files for insights.**
